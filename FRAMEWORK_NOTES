TODO: --> Research Python, Django, and kubernetes clusters + docker --> How to implement

	--> I want a user portal accessible from anywhere
		|
		|
		-->You can access dockers prestaged with different configured OS's
		-->Each OS will have a task selection like Forensics / pwnrev/ etc
			|
			--> They will be loaded with the tools required for each
	--> Where are the files stored --> FTP alongside the client server



~!!!!!!~-->Topology will be filled later after more research is done
